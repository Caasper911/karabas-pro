To compile project all you need is [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus).

You may use or not use GNU Make. But for just build enought only sjasmplus: `sjasmplus main.asm`.

To getting working distro you'll need:

Some parts based on my Internet NEXTplorer(for zx spectrum next) and MSX's version of Moon Rabbit.
